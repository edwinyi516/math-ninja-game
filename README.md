    After a week-long warmup <a href="https://github.com/edwinyi516/charmagotchi-mini-project">mini project</a> and eight weeks since writing my first ever line of code, I have completed my first app fully from inception to deployment!<br>
    I implemented JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills acquired from the first six weeks of my bootcamp, as well as an abundance of reading and learning from documentation found online.<br><br>
    The difficulties I encountered and resolved while creating the mini project served to enhance my process of creating this game.<br>
    Even with the increased complexity, building this app was much more fluid and methodical due to the insight I was able to gain from my mistakes and shortcomings while creating the mini project.<br><br>
    One obstacle I encountered was making the app responsive, especially with the in-game character animations. I was able to adapt for most common screen/window resolutions, but the app may not function fully as intended with extreme cases.<br>
    I have read that frameworks like Bootstrap can simplify the process and handle responsiveness much more efficiently than vanilla CSS, so I am looking forward to working with them in the near future.<br><br>
    Please feel free to leave any feedback/suggestions!
